# Customer invoice manager

Custom invoice manager is a small php application made from scratch. Why I made this application:

  - To keep track of my invoices.
  - To learn more about OOP PHP (and practice it)
  - Magic âœ¨

## Features

  - Twig templating
  - Inovice to PDF
  - Pay invoice online with stripe
  - Automatically e-mail invoices
  - Automatic payment reminders by e-mail
  - Automatic payment reminders by SMS (Twillio)
